# Hello 👋👨🏻‍💻

I've been programming as a hobby for as long as I can remember, when I was just a kid I already showed interest in numbers and technology. I decided to pursue a programming career just over five years ago, when I decided to open my own business. From them on, the learning journey has been long and satisfying, today I consider myself a professional still in the learning phase, but with experience and a lot of desire to grow.
